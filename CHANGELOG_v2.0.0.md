## 🧠 **AI-ENHANCED BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE**

### **Sample Query Results:**
```
🔍 Query: "What are the top performing business units?"

📊 Response: [v2.0-DirectOnly-ForceUpdate: Execution started at 15:31:51] [Completed in 20.7s]
[Direct execution: 9.7s] 

**Top Performing Business Units Analysis**

Based on your inquiry, we have analyzed the performance of our business units to identify the top 10 units by sales performance...

Generated SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT business_unit, SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales
FROM aiops_app_catalog.c809384.orders 
GROUP BY business_unit 
ORDER BY total_sales DESC 
LIMIT 10
```

Data Results:
business_unit    total_sales
Technology       $2,450,000
Healthcare       $1,890,000
Finance          $1,650,000
...
```

## 📋 **DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS**

### **🚨 CRITICAL: Update Environment Variables**

The most common issue is placeholder tokens. Ensure your Databricks App has:

```yaml
env:
  - name: "DATABRICKS_TOKEN"
    value: "dapi-your-actual-token-here"  # NOT "your-databricks-token"!
  - name: "DATABRICKS_HOST"
    value: "https://your-workspace.azuredatabricks.net"
  - name: "GENIE_SPACE_ID"
    value: "your-actual-genie-space-id"
```

### **🚀 Deployment Options**

#### **Option A: Direct Environment Update (RECOMMENDED)**
1. Go to your Databricks App settings
2. Update `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` environment variable directly
3. Restart the app

#### **Option B: Redeploy with Updated Configuration**
```bash
# Update app.yaml with real values
# Then redeploy
databricks apps create --source-dir . --app-name ai-bi-agent
```
